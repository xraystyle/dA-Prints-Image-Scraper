dA-Prints-Image-Scraper
=======================

Ruby script that uses the Mechanize gem to scrape all the full-size images associated with the prints
a deviantART user has for sale on their profile.

DOESN'T CURRENTLY WORK FOR DEVIATIONS MARKED MATURE!

Mechanize can handle sessions and forms, I'll build a login method for it so it can grab mature deviations as well.
